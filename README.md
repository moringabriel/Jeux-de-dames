# Jeux-de-dames

Final project for a python introduction class.

This is a game that was collaboratively coded remotely with a class mate. The assignment cumulated all are acquired learning and more. 

During this exploration, I was able to learn more about UI interface. In the end, I integrated with TK inter, some visual effects to declare the winner of the games.
